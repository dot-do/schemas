# Cold Email Campaign Schema

Comprehensive schema for defining cold email outreach campaigns with multi-step sequences, advanced targeting, A/B testing, and performance analytics.

## Overview

This schema supports:
- **Multi-step sequences**: Define follow-up emails with delays
- **A/B testing**: Test subject lines, body content, sender names
- **Smart scheduling**: Respect timezones, sending windows, throttling
- **Advanced targeting**: Filter by industry, title, company size
- **Real-time analytics**: Track opens, clicks, replies, conversions

## Campaign Lifecycle

```
draft → active → (paused) → completed → archived
```

## Sequence Design

Each campaign contains one or more sequences. Each sequence contains one or more emails with delays between steps.

**Example:**
```
Step 1: Initial outreach (Day 0)
Step 2: Follow-up #1 (Day 3)
Step 3: Follow-up #2 (Day 7)
Step 4: Breakup email (Day 14)
```

## A/B Testing

Test different variants of:
- Subject lines
- Email body content
- Sender names
- CTA buttons

Traffic is automatically split based on allocation percentages.

## Analytics & Optimization

Track campaign performance in real-time:
- **Delivery rate**: delivered / sent
- **Open rate**: opened / delivered
- **Click rate**: clicked / opened
- **Reply rate**: replied / delivered
- **Conversion rate**: conversions / sent

## Best Practices

1. **Personalization**: Use template variables for dynamic content
2. **Timing**: Respect recipient timezone and business hours
3. **Throttling**: Gradually ramp up sending volume
4. **Testing**: Always A/B test subject lines
5. **Follow-ups**: Include 2-3 follow-ups for higher response rates
6. **Unsubscribes**: Honor opt-out requests immediately
