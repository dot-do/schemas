# Email Sequence Schema

Defines a multi-step email sequence for cold outreach campaigns.

## Features

- **Multi-Step Sequences**: Chain multiple emails with delays
- **Conditional Logic**: Send based on recipient behavior (opened, clicked, replied)
- **Template Variables**: Personalize with {{firstName}}, {{company}}, etc.
- **Time Optimization**: Send during business hours, respect timezones
- **Smart Rules**: Stop on reply, skip weekends, max follow-ups
- **Full Tracking**: Opens, clicks, replies, unsubscribes

## Step Types

1. **Initial Outreach** (Step 1): First contact email
2. **Follow-ups** (Steps 2+): Conditional based on behavior
3. **Breakup Email** (Final): Last attempt before giving up

## Conditional Execution

Steps can execute conditionally:

- **always**: Always send (default)
- **if_no_reply**: Only if no reply to previous emails
- **if_no_open**: Only if didn't open previous email
- **if_no_click**: Only if didn't click links
- **custom**: Custom expression

## Template Variables

Common variables:
- {{firstName}}, {{lastName}}, {{fullName}}
- {{company}}, {{industry}}, {{title}}
- {{unsubscribeUrl}}, {{replyUrl}}

## Timing Best Practices

- Send Tuesday-Thursday for best response rates
- 9am-4pm in recipient timezone
- Wait 2-3 days between follow-ups
- Max 3-4 follow-ups before stopping

## Analytics

Track sequence performance:
- Response rate by step
- Time to reply
- Drop-off points
- Conversion funnel
