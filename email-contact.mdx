# Email Contact Schema

Comprehensive contact record for cold email campaigns with built-in validation, enrichment, and engagement tracking.

## Overview

This schema represents a contact in the cold email system with:
- **Email Validation**: Real-time validation with scoring
- **Data Enrichment**: Automatic enrichment from external sources
- **Engagement Tracking**: Complete email interaction history
- **List Management**: Multiple list memberships and custom tags
- **Compliance**: Unsubscribe tracking and bounce management

## Contact Lifecycle

```
created → validated → enriched → targeted → engaged → (converted | unsubscribed | unresponsive)
```

## Validation Scoring

Email validation produces a 0-100 score based on:
- **Syntax**: Valid RFC 5322 format (critical)
- **MX Records**: Deliverable domain (critical)
- **Disposable Detection**: Not a temporary email (high)
- **Role Detection**: Not a generic role address (medium)
- **Catch-all Detection**: Domain doesn't accept all emails (low)

**Score Ranges:**
- **90-100**: Excellent - Very likely deliverable
- **70-89**: Good - Likely deliverable
- **50-69**: Fair - May have issues
- **0-49**: Poor - Likely undeliverable

## Enrichment Sources

Contact data can be enriched from:
- **Apollo.io**: B2B contact data, company info, technographics
- **Clearbit**: Company and person enrichment
- **Hunter.io**: Email discovery and verification
- **LinkedIn**: Professional profiles and experience
- **Custom Sources**: Integration-specific enrichment

**Confidence Scoring**: Each enrichment includes a confidence score (0-100) indicating data quality.

## Engagement Scoring

Engagement score (0-100) is calculated based on:
- **Opens**: +5 points per open (max 25)
- **Clicks**: +10 points per click (max 30)
- **Replies**: +15 points per reply (max 45)

**Engagement Status:**
- **Cold**: 0-25 score, no engagement
- **Warm**: 26-50 score, some opens/clicks
- **Hot**: 51-100 score, active engagement with replies
- **Unresponsive**: 5+ emails sent, no opens
- **Unsubscribed**: Opted out

## List Management

Contacts can belong to multiple lists:
- **Static Lists**: Manually created or CSV imported
- **Dynamic Lists**: Auto-updated based on criteria
- **Campaign Lists**: Generated from campaign targeting

**Tags**: Custom tags enable flexible segmentation beyond lists.

## Personalization

Custom fields support dynamic template variables:

```
Hi {{firstName}},

I noticed {{company.name}} is in the {{company.industry}} industry...
```

## Compliance & Deliverability

### Unsubscribe Management
- Honor unsubscribe requests immediately
- Track unsubscribe reason for insights
- Never re-add unsubscribed contacts to campaigns

### Bounce Handling
- **Hard Bounces**: Permanent failure, mark invalid
- **Soft Bounces**: Temporary failure, retry with exponential backoff
- **Complaints**: Spam report, unsubscribe and flag

### List Hygiene
- Remove hard bounces immediately
- Re-validate soft bounces after 30 days
- Monitor engagement and remove unresponsive (90+ days)

## Data Privacy

- **GDPR Compliance**: Support for right to erasure
- **CAN-SPAM Act**: Required unsubscribe mechanism
- **Data Retention**: Configurable retention policies
- **PII Protection**: Encrypt sensitive fields at rest

## Best Practices

1. **Validation First**: Always validate before sending
2. **Enrich Early**: Enrich immediately after creation for better targeting
3. **Segment Carefully**: Use lists and tags for precise targeting
4. **Monitor Engagement**: Track scores and adjust strategy
5. **Clean Regularly**: Remove bounces and unresponsive contacts
6. **Respect Opt-outs**: Honor unsubscribes immediately
